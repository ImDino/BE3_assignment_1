# Backend assignment - MERN stack

## Requirements

* Create a Todo App that lets the user CRUD todo-lists.

* Use NodeJS (with ExpressJS) as your framework, MongoDB as a database, and ReactJS on the front-end.

* Every list item should include a title, content, and date (from the last edit).

## Additional reqirements for a better grade

* Support multiple users, either by username & password or by federated login.

* User credentials and todo items must be protected from other users.

* Each todo needs to be formattable by markdown.

* At least one unit test on both back- and front-end.

* Your code needs to pass a static code analysis test without any warnings.


**Personal notes**

* Due to this being a backend assignment I paid little to no attention to the styling.

* react-google-login was used for the federated login and you will be given an error if your browser blocks third party cookies.
